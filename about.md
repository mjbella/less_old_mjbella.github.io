My name is Michael Bella, I am an Electrical Engineer who likes to hack away at
different projects in my spare time.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from SJSU

I am currently a Hardware Validation Engineer at Google where I work to ensure
new data center hardware designs will work well when being built and installed
in large volumes.
